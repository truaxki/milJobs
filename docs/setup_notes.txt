# MilJobs Setup Documentation Notes

These notes detail the complete setup process for the Google Cloud Platform integration with MilJobs. This file is meant for development reference and should not be tracked in Git.

## Google Cloud Platform Complete Setup Guide

### Initial Project Creation
The first step is setting up a new project in Google Cloud Platform. When creating the project, consider using a descriptive name that reflects its purpose, such as 'miljobs-prod' or 'miljobs-dev'. The project ID will be needed for configuration later.

### API Configuration Details
The Cloud Talent Solution API needs to be enabled for the project. This API provides the core functionality for job search and matching. During the enablement process, Google Cloud may automatically enable some dependent APIs as well.

### Service Account Setup Process
When creating the service account, consider these additional security practices:
1. Use a descriptive display name and ID that indicates the account's purpose
2. Keep the private key file secure and never commit it to version control
3. Consider setting up separate service accounts for development and production
4. Regularly audit and rotate service account keys

### Detailed Role Requirements
The service account needs specific roles for proper operation:
- Cloud Talent Solution Job Editor: Allows creating and managing job postings
- Cloud Talent Solution Profile Editor: Enables managing candidate profiles
- Cloud Talent Solution API User: Provides basic API access
- Consider additional roles based on specific feature needs

### Environment Configuration Best Practices
Structure your environment variables carefully:
```
# Required GCP Settings
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=your-project-id
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./path/to/credentials.json

# Optional Configuration
TALENT_SOLUTION_PARENT=projects/{project_id}  # For API calls
```

### Security Considerations
Additional security measures to consider:
1. Store credentials outside the project directory
2. Use environment-specific .env files (.env.development, .env.production)
3. Implement credential rotation schedules
4. Monitor API usage and set up alerts

### API Usage Optimization
Best practices for API implementation:
1. Cache frequently requested data
2. Implement proper error handling for API limits
3. Use batch operations when possible
4. Monitor API quotas and usage

### Development Workflow
Suggested workflow for implementing new features:
1. Test API calls in isolated environment first
2. Implement error handling before adding features
3. Add logging for debugging
4. Create separate service accounts for testing

### Common Issues and Solutions
Frequent setup challenges:
1. API enablement delays - may take a few minutes to propagate
2. Permission inheritance issues - check parent resource permissions
3. Credential path issues - use absolute paths in production
4. Project ID vs Project Name confusion - always use Project ID in configurations

### Testing Setup
To verify the setup:
1. Test API connectivity
2. Verify permission scopes
3. Check rate limits
4. Validate error handling

### Deployment Considerations
Key points for production deployment:
1. Use environment-specific service accounts
2. Implement proper secret management
3. Set up monitoring and alerting
4. Configure appropriate logging levels

This documentation will be updated as we develop the application further and discover new best practices or requirements.
